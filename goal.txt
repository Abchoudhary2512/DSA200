Basic Math & Recursion (e.g., Count Digits, Reverse Number, GCD/HCF, Armstrong check, basic recursion drills)

Arrays & Sorting (~50 questions): subarray sums, two‑pointer patterns (2-Sum, 3-Sum, 4-Sum), Kadane’s, next‐permutation, matrix rotations, etc.

Binary Search & Searching: lower/upper bounds, searches in rotated/sorted arrays, kth‑element in 2 sorted arrays, advanced tasks like Aggressive Cows (search on answers).

Hashing & Sliding Window: anagram checks, longest subarray sum, min-window substring, LFU/most K occurrences, group anagrams, etc.

Strings: reverse words, Roman ↔ integer, palindrome substrings, KMP, Z‑algorithm, smallest window covering another string, etc.

Linked Lists: basics like insert/delete, search, plus reverse, detect cycle, merge, reorder, etc.

Stacks/Queues: parentheses matching, sliding window max, monotonic stacks, evaluate RPN, etc.

Trees & Graphs: traversal, LCA, tree diameter, serialize/deserialize, BFS/DFS, cycle detection, shortest paths, topological sort, etc.
